        About Netzob
        ============
        
        Functional Description
        -----------------------
        
        Netzob is an opensource tool for reverse engineering, traffic generation
        and fuzzing of communication protocols. This tool allows to infer the message format (vocabulary)
        and the state machine (grammar) of a protocol through passive and active processes.
        Its objective is to bring state of art academic researches to the operational field,
        by leveraging bio-informatic and grammatical inferring algorithms in a semi-automatic manner.
        
        Netzob is suitable for reversing network protocols, structured files and system and
        process flows (IPC and communication with drivers and devices).
        Once inferred, a protocol model can be used in our traffic generation engine, to allow simulation of realistic
        and controllable communication endpoints and flows.
        
        Netzob handles different types of protocols: text protocols (like HTTP and IRC), delimiter-based protocols,
        fixed fields protocols (like IP and TCP) and variable-length fields protocols (like TLV-based protocols).
        
        Technical Description
        ---------------------
        
        This version of Netzob must be used as a Python 3 library. It can either be imported in your scripts
        or in your favorite interactive shell (ipython?).
        
        Once installed, we recommend the following statement to import Netzob::
        
          from netzob.all import *
        
        Netzob's source code is mostly made of Python (90%) with some specific extensions in C (6%).

        Get Started with Netzob
        =======================
        
        Install it
        ----------
        
        First thing to do is to check the version of your python3 interpretor.
        Netzob requires python 3::
        
          $ python3 --version
          Python 3.4.2
        
        As a 'classic' python project, Netzob is provided with its
        ``setup.py``. This file defines what and how to install the project on a
        python hosting OS.
        
        This file depends on ``setuptools`` which like few other modules cannot be
        automatically installed. The reason why, you have to manually install the
        following bunch of prerequisites before initiating Netzob's install process.
        
        * python3
        * python3-dev
        * python3-setuptools
        * build-essential  
          
        We also highly recommend to install the following additional dependencies:
        
        * python-sphinx (for the documentation)
        
        Once the required dependencies are installed, you can build and install Netzob::
        
          # python3 setup.py install
        
        Or if you prefer a more developer-friendly install::
        
          $ python3 setup.py develop --user
        
          
        Docker container
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        A docker build is offered from the docker registry repository. You can download 
        it from command line with the following command:: 
        
          $ docker pull netzob/netzob
        
        
        Start it
        --------
        
        Once installed, running Netzob is as simple as executing the provided script::
        
          $ ./netzob
        
        This script is in Python's path if you've installed Netzob, otherwise
        (in developer mode), it's located in the top distribution directory.
        
        Docker container
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If you used the docker container, the following command will allow you to start 
        netzob with your current directory attached to ``/data`` into the container::
        
          $ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data netzob/netzob
        
        Miscellaneous
        -------------
        
        Configuration of Log Level
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Environment variable ```NETZOB_LOG_VERBOSITY``` can be use to set the logging level. The numeric values of logging levels are given in the Python Documentation of the `Logging Module <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/logging.html#levels>`_. For example, the following command starts netzob in *DEBUG* mode::
        
          $ NETZOB_LOG_LEVEL=10 ./netzob
        
        Configuration requirements for Network and PCAP input
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Capturing data from network interfaces often requires admin privileges. 
        Before we provide a cleaner and secure way (see issue 425 on the bugtracker for updated information - https://dev.netzob.org/issues/425), a possible *HACK* is to provide additional capabilities to the python binary::
        
        $ sudo setcap cap_net_raw=ep /usr/bin/python3.XX
        
        Configuration requirements for IPC input on Ubuntu
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The following command must be triggered before collecting IPC exchanges with Netzob on Ubuntu (see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt)::
        
        $ sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope"
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The folder ``doc/documentation`` contains all the documentation of Netzob.
        
        The user manual can be generated based on RST sources located in folder
        ``doc/documentation/source`` with the following commands::
        
          $ sphinx-apidoc -T -e -f -o doc/documentation/source/developer_guide/API/ src/netzob/
          $ find doc/documentation/source/developer_guide/API/ -type f -exec sed -i ':a;N;$!ba;s/Subpackages\n-----------\n\n.. toctree::\n/Subpackages\n-----------\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 1\n    /g' {} +
          $ sphinx-build -b html doc/documentation/source/ doc/documentation/build/
        
        An up-to-date version of the documentation is hosted on the `Read The Docs platform <https://netzob.readthedocs.org>`_.
