Description: The PRISMA package is capable of loading and processing huge text corpora processed with the sally toolbox (http://www.mlsec.org/sally/). sally acts as a ver fast preprocessor which splits the text files into tokens or n-grams. These output files can then be read with the PRISMA package which applies testing-based token selection and has some duplicat-aware, highly tuned Non-Negative Matrix Factorzation and Principal component Analysis implementation which allows the processing of very big data sets even on desktop machines.
